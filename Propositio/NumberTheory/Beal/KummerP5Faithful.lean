# Faithful Kummer p=5 capstone — correcting the over-strong `hunit`

`BealKummerP5Assembly.beal_55z_kummer_conditional` states the (5,5,z) Beal reduction
conditional on

  `hunit : ∀ v : (𝓞 K)ˣ, v ∈ realUnits K → ∃ w, v = w ^ z`

i.e. *every* real unit is a `z`-th power.  **This hypothesis is over-strong — in fact
false for `z ≥ 2`**: the fundamental unit `φ = 1 + ζ + ζ⁴` is a real unit but is not a
`z`-th power (it is a generator of the rank-1 unit group modulo torsion).  A conditional
theorem with a false hypothesis is vacuously true and **can never be discharged**, so it
does not represent an honest frontier.

The *faithful* statement quantifies over only the **specific** descent unit `v` that the
reduction `beal_55z_reduced_to_real_unit` actually produces (which already packages the
conditional `(∃ w, v = w^z) → …`).  That conditional is dischargeable: `v = ±φⁿ` (the
fundamental unit theorem, proved as `beal_fundamental_unit_sqrt5_statement`), and `±φⁿ`
is a `z`-th power **iff `z ∣ n`** (for `z` odd, which holds since `gcd(z,10)=1`).

So the honest remaining input for the (5,5,z) family is the single divisibility

  `z ∣ n`   (where `v = ±φⁿ` is the descent unit's golden-ratio exponent),

which is an effective height bound on a linear form in logarithms of the *algebraic* unit
`φ` — genuinely Baker-class, and (unlike the Collatz `PowGap`, which is now reduced to the
*rational* irrationality measure of `log₂3`) it has no clean elementary slack.  The
corpus's "5th-power ⟹ `z`-th-power" step (`BealKummerP5Assembly` Wrapper 3, step 5) is the
**logical error**: in the infinite cyclic group `⟨φ⟩`, `v = w⁵` with `gcd(z,5)=1` does NOT
give `v = u^z` — that needs `z ∣ n`, not `5 ∣ n`.  The `mod λ⁴` analysis delivers only
`5 ∣ n` (necessary, not sufficient).

This file records the faithful capstone and isolates `z ∣ n` as the clean honest input.

`z`-th power.  (The descent unit's exponent `n` is an integer; `φ` lives in the group
`(𝓞 K)ˣ`.)  The `−φⁿ` branch of the fundamental unit theorem is analogous for **odd** `z`
(which holds since `gcd(z,10)=1 ⟹ z` odd): `−1` is a central involution, so
`(−1)·xⁿ = (−x^{n/z})^z`. -/

/-- **`beal_55z_kummer_faithful` — the corrected (5,5,z) capstone.**

Same conclusion as `BealKummerP5Assembly.beal_55z_kummer_conditional`, but conditional on
the **specific** descent unit `v` (exposed in the existential) being a `z`-th power — the
honest, *dischargeable* hypothesis — rather than the false `∀ real unit, is a z-th power`.

1. (Unconditional) `A + B = sᶻ`.
2. (Conditional, faithfully) there is a real unit `v` such that **if that `v`** is a
   `z`-th power then `A + B·ζ = Dᶻ`.

By the fundamental unit theorem `v = ±φⁿ`, so the hypothesis `∃ w, v = wᶻ` is exactly
`z ∣ n` (via §1) — the single Baker-class input.  No false universal. -/
