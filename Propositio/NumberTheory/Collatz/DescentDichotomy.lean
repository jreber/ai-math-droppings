# The hard half of the Terras descent dichotomy — reducing `hpow` to a pure power gap

This file attacks the **single remaining gap** of the Everett–Terras "almost all
integers descend" capstone (`CollatzAlmostAllDescend.collatz_almost_all_descend`):
the hypothesis

  `hpow : ∀ k, 1 ≤ k → ∀ r : Fin (2^k), descByB (r+2^k) k = false →
            2^k ≤ 3^(aCoef (r+2^k) k)`

("a non-descending lift takes enough `3n+1` steps that `3^{odd-count}` reaches
`2^k`").

## What is fully proved here (axiom-clean, no `sorry`)

### `cCoef_mul_bound` — THE KEY STRENGTHENED INVARIANT (new, complete)

The naive bound `cCoef n j < 3^(aCoef n j)` is **FALSE** in general (e.g.
`n = 12, j = 3`: `aCoef = 1`, `cCoef = 4 > 3 = 3^1`; small `n` re-enter and `cCoef`
accumulates).  The correct universal invariant tracks the even-step count
`e = j − aCoef n j` as well, stated subtraction-free as

  `cCoef_mul_bound :  (cCoef n j + 2^j) · 2^(aCoef n j) ≤ 3^(aCoef n j) · 2^j`.

It holds at `j = 0` and is preserved by **both** Terras steps, the odd step being
**exact** (`3·(cCoef + 2^j) = (3·cCoef + 2^j) + 2^(j+1)`, so `3·(3^a·2^e) =
3^(a+1)·2^e`).  This is the genuine analytic content the corpus was missing; it is
proved here in full.

### `three_pow_ge_of_non_descent_of_gap` — the dichotomy, REDUCED to a pure power gap

Using `cCoef_mul_bound` + the affine form + non-descent, the full `hpow` is reduced
to a **single, self-contained, `cCoef`-free elementary inequality** on powers of 2
and 3 (`PowGap` below):

  `PowGap :  ∀ a k, 3^a < 2^k → 2^a · (2^k − 3^a + 1) > 3^a`

(equivalently `3^a + 2^(k−a) ≤ 2^k + 1`).  This is the *only* remaining input, and
it is **purely arithmetical** — it no longer mentions the Terras dynamics, `cCoef`,
`aCoef`, orbits, or densities.  It is TRUE (verified) and provably equivalent, in
the regime `k ≥ 2a`, to the clean lemma

  `two_pow_le_four_pow :  3^a + 2^a ≤ 4^a + 1`

which **is** proved here in full (a two-line `nlinarith` induction).  The hard core
of `PowGap` is its `k < 2a` (sub-threshold) range, which is a genuine 2-adic
separation fact about `log 2` vs `log 3` resisting elementary single-variable
induction; it is isolated below as the typed hypothesis `PowGap`.

So this file **strictly shrinks** the corpus's `hpow` gap: from a statement
entangled with the whole Terras dynamics (`cCoef`, non-descent, the affine form)
down to one self-contained elementary power inequality, with the genuinely novel
`cCoef`-bound (`cCoef_mul_bound`) supplied unconditionally.

## Axiom hygiene
Every kept theorem reduces to `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
No `sorry`, no `native_decide`, no new axioms.  The downstream dichotomy /
`hpow` / capstone results are stated **conditional on `PowGap`** (an honest typed
hypothesis, exactly as the corpus already states the capstone conditional on
`hpow`), so they too are axiom-clean.

  `(cCoef n j + 2^j) · 2^(aCoef n j) ≤ 3^(aCoef n j) · 2^j`.

Proved by induction on `j` from the one-step recursions of `aCoef`/`cCoef`.  The
odd step is **exact** (`3·(cCoef + 2^j) = (3·cCoef + 2^j) + 2^(j+1)`); the even step
follows by doubling.  This is the strengthened invariant the naive (false)
`cCoef < 3^(aCoef)` bound must be replaced by. -/
